MergeAlternatively code explaination

My code effectively merges two strings, word1 and word2, by alternating their characters and then appending any remaining characters from the longer string. Here's a detailed explanation:

Initialization:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
Creates a StringBuilder to build the result string efficiently.

int i = 0; and int j = 0;
These are indices for iterating through word1 and word2, respectively.

boolean flag = true;
This boolean flag helps alternate between characters from word1 and word2.

Alternating Character Addition:

while(i < word1.length() && j < word2.length()){ ... }
This loop runs as long as there are characters left in both word1 and word2. Inside this loop:
If flag is true, it appends the current character from word1 to sb and increments i.
If flag is false, it appends the current character from word2 to sb and increments j.
After each iteration, flag = !flag; switches the flag's value to alternate between word1 and word2.

Appending Remaining Characters:

while(i < word1.length()){ ... }
If word1 is longer than word2, this loop appends the remaining characters from word1 to sb.
while(j < word2.length()){ ... }
Similarly, if word2 is longer than word1, this loop appends the remaining characters from word2 to sb.

Return Statement:

return sb.toString();
Finally, the merged string is returned as the output.
